/**
 Provides the video resource.
 Checks the portrait features and enviroment before the start of recording.
 
 @warning There is a visual problem with AVCaptureSession outputs switching.
 If an output is changed to another one, the device display turns dark and the picture appears again after about 0.5 seconds.
 So it is necessary to call -showSnapshot: and -hideSnapshot: methods to patch it
